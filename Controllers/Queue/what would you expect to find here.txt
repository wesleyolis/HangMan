Here you should find all api endpoints that function like a queue, which means, as long as it is just a queue, there just a delay
and won't exhaust your connection pool, there for things remiain running.

One can uses notification protocals to push the information using websocks back to the client, or poll, if become overwelm with connections,
but problem is there is period of time before a port can be reused.
