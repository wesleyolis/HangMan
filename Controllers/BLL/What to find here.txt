Business logic for the backend should be placed here.

The thing with business logic, typically they like to customize it with there are two has base class interface
then specialization of that, but it becomes dam complex to follow all the hooks, what is customized and were it is customized.
Especially at design time, because need to know who all inheriates from this thing, which out test on this business logic
one is going to be really stuffed, because some can back the core business logic, while specializing and instance
and at times some people copy and past duplicate the core code, so that problem is that this were things are going to really go wrong and go wrong quickly.


If there is share business logic, which tends to mend its self with validation,
then that needs to be defined in a common folder format, of custom validation from a schema or javascript run on the backend as well.
