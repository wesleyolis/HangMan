What you would find here are units of code, picture it as code blocks, in any engineer program like simulink, wonderware, process manager.
were chain blocks togather, so that they can perform custom user configurable actions

The define an interface for all the configurable parameters for creating and innstance of this code block.
teh configurable params, have know values that are enums or belong to a know set, 
variables with no constraints, are consider pass tought that there should be no braning logic or conditional logic acting on them,
this allows this unit of code to be testable to ensure it works, before top level chaining or piping of information between codeUnits.

Params that are passed between code units allso need to define there parameters, so that we only allow code units
to be used were all require input information is avaliable.

All this meta data should be index from the filesystem and pushed to UI desgin and never stored in the database, as there be mistakes and it now is testable
with the information in the same souce file.

CodeUnits for input data, may need to spesify a list of TO or DAL/Model information required to be input,
in which there needs to be codeunit input data loaders
The runner harnus would probably be a seperate application, which would allow us to use amazon SQS and SNS SWF if need be,
but just use our own internal system, as so much over head to that.
